Project Goal: Build a live MVP dashboard showing trending penny stocks from Reddit discussions

STEP 1: Choose Tech Stack

- Consider your existing skills and speed requirements
- Options: Next.js/React, Python/Flask, or other preferred stack

STEP 2: Setup Development Environment
- Create project structure
- Install dependencies
- Set up version control (Git)

STEP 3: Build Reddit Data Collection

- Calculate discussion volume and trending metrics
- Store processed data (JSON file or simple database)

STEP 5: Create Data API

STEP 6: Build Dashboard UI
- Create interface matching the dark theme design concept
- Display trending stocks list (left panel)
- Add stock detail views (right panel)
- Make it responsive for mobile

STEP 7: Deploy to Production
- Set up hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, or similar)
- Set up site analytics
- Deploy application
- Configure domain (optional - can use free subdomain)

STEP 8: Test and Validate
- Test live application functionality
- Share with target audience (r/pennystocks community)
- Collect feedback and usage data
- Measure if people actually use it

SUCCESS METRICS:
- People visit the site
- Users return to check trends
- Community engagement and feedback
- Feature requests from users

TIMELINE: 3-5 days total
COST: $0-20 for first month (free hosting tiers)
